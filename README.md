## Hi I'm Vinzent ðŸ‘‹
I think software is still craftsmanship. It's an art form: solving puzzles day to day, with my favorite tech stacks.

I've spent the last 10 years developing, iterating, improving and building real products. From modifications with ~30,000 users up to full a cloud platform and different SaaS I've built and owned full-stack applications end-to-end, developed libraries, explored low-level programming, always focusing on scalability, performance, UX and (very importantly) DX.

I like self-hosting and the devops associated with it, though I like practical engineering and theorizing about architecture more.

I specialize in **React**, **TypeScript**, **Databases** and **Java**. But I am very open minded.

### Knowledge
I have sufficient experience or expertise in following:
- **Languages:** Java, TypeScript, Sass/CSS & Tailwind, SQL, PL/pgSQL
- **Frameworks:** Astro, React, NextJS, Express, Fastify, ...
- **Tools**: Figma, Git, Vercel, Supabase, Maven, Gradle, AWS S3/Cloudflare R2, Dokploy, Coolify, ...
- **ORMs**: Hibernate, ORMLite, Prisma, Supabase, Drizzle
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, ...
- **Testing**: JUnit, Jest, Vitest, Mocha
- **Architectures:** Microservices, Monolithic, Monorepos, REST

Worth mentioning experiences:
- Laravel, PHP 7.4-8.1 (_2019-2022_)
- C, C++ (_2022-2023_)
- jQuery (_2015-2019_)
