## Wassup 🎉
I think software is still **craftsmanship** somewhere. It's an art form. Solving puzzles day to day, with my favorite tech stacks, laying the foundation for future engineers to iterate upon.

I've spent the last 10 years developing, iterating, improving and building **real products**. From modifications with **~30,000** users up to a cloud platform and different SaaS, I've built and owned full-stack applications end-to-end, developed libraries, explored low-level programming, always focusing on scalability, performance, UX and (very importantly) DX. I've also lead several QA stages and owned entire pipelines from A through Z.

I like self-hosting and the devops associated with it, though I like practical engineering and theorizing about architecture more.

I specialize in **React**, **TypeScript**, **Databases** and **Java**. But I am very open minded.

### Knowledge
I have sufficient experience or expertise in following:
- **Languages:** Java, TypeScript, Sass/CSS & Tailwind, SQL, PL/pgSQL
- **Frameworks:** Astro, React, NextJS, Express, Fastify, Vike, ...
- **Tools**: Figma, Git, Vercel, Supabase, Maven, Gradle, AWS S3/Cloudflare R2, Dokploy, Coolify, ...
